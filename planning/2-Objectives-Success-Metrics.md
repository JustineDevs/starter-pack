## How Metrics Connect to Roadmap

Every roadmap item maps to one or more KPIs:
- **Feature X** → Increases feature adoption by [X%]
- **Partnership Y** → Enables $[X] revenue + [X] new users
- **Marketing Z** → Drives [X] new GitHub stars, [X] new users
- **Hiring W** → Enables [X% reduction] in MTTR, [X% increase] in deployment frequency

When prioritizing work, always ask: **"Which roadmap items have the highest impact on our Day 30/60/90 success metrics?"**
