## How Sections Connect in Practice

### Example: A Feature Request Comes In

**Scenario:** Day 15, engineer suggests adding LLM integration feature

1. **Check Section 3 (Scope):** Is LLM integration in-scope? *No, deferred to Phase 4*
2. **Check Section 8 (Execution):** How do we handle scope change? *Tier 2 - Product + Tech Lead discuss*
3. **Check Section 7 (Risk):** Is adding this a risk? *Yes, timeline slip risk*
4. **Check Section 5 (Timeline):** Can we fit this in? *Only if we cut equal work*
3. **Check Section 2 (Metrics):** Does this help us hit Day 30 goals? *No, doesn't impact MVP metrics*
6. **Decision:** Defer to Phase 3; add to backlog; document in Section 3 change log

### Example: We're Behind Schedule

**Scenario:** Day 25, we're only 60% done with Phase 2 work

1. **Check Section 9 (Monitoring):** Review daily metrics - what's causing delay? *Security audit taking longer than expected*
2. **Check Section 7 (Risk):** Was this risk identified? *Yes, "Security audit delay" was Tier 2 risk*
3. **Check Section 7 (Risk):** What was mitigation plan? *Hire external auditor in parallel; we did*
4. **Check Section 5 (Timeline):** What's our critical path? *Can we slip audit 1 week without delaying launch?*
5. **Check Section 11 (Governance):** Who decides? *Steering committee emergency meeting*
6. **Decision:** Extend Phase 2 by 1 week; notify stakeholders; adjust Section 2 Day 30 gate criteria

## Customization Guide

This Starter Pack uses **[Brackets]** for placeholders. Customize by:

1. **Project-specific:** Replace `[Your Project Name]` with actual project name
2. **Timeline-specific:** Replace `[Weeks X-Y]` with your actual timeline
3. **Role-specific:** Replace `[Name]` with actual team member names
4. **Context-specific:** Replace example metrics/features with your actual metrics/features

**Pro Tip:** Keep the template structure (headers, section names) but customize all content to your context.
