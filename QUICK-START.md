# QUICK START

5-minute overview of the complete Project Planning Starter Pack system.

## What This System Does

A complete framework for planning, executing, and delivering technical projects. It combines:

- **Strategic Planning** - 12-section planning framework
- **Technical Execution** - 200+ page implementation guide
- **AI Assistance** - 6 auto-activated Claude skills
- **Automation** - CI/CD pipelines and quality gates
- **Documentation** - Reference guides and templates

## The 12 Planning Sections

1. **Executive Summary** - Vision, problem, solution overview
2. **Objectives & Success Metrics** - Quantified goals and KPIs
3. **Scope Definition** - What's in, what's out, constraints
4. **System Architecture** - Technical design and component specs
5. **Project Phases & Timeline** - Milestones and critical path
6. **Resource Planning** - Team structure and budget
7. **Risk Management** - Risk register and mitigation strategies
8. **Execution Strategy** - Daily workflow and ceremonies
9. **Monitoring & Reporting** - Metrics dashboards and status reports
10. **ROI & Value Realization** - Financial projections and break-even
11. **Governance & Decision-Making** - Authority matrix and escalation
12. **Lessons Learned** - Continuous improvement and knowledge capture

## The 7 Claude Skills

Auto-activated AI assistance for key decisions:

1. **tech-stack-selector** - Choose technologies
2. **architecture-decisions** - Document ADRs
3. **code-standards-enforcer** - Enforce quality
4. **ci-cd-pipeline-builder** - Automate deployment
5. **agile-executor** - Run sprints
6. **project-risk-identifier** - Identify risks
7. **automation-orchestrator** - Manage setup/validate/deploy scripts

## How Sections Connect

```
Executive Summary (Why)
    ↓
Objectives & Metrics (What success looks like)
    ↓
Scope Definition (What's in/out)
    ↓
Architecture (How)
    ↓
Timeline → Resources → Risks
    ↓
Execution Strategy (Daily work)
    ↓
Monitoring → ROI → Governance

Lessons Learned (Continuous improvement)
```

## Recommended Workflow

### Week 1: Planning
- Complete Sections 1-3 (Executive Summary, Objectives, Scope)
- Review Section 4 (Architecture)
- Use tech-stack-selector skill

### Week 2: Foundation
- Complete Sections 5-8 (Timeline, Resources, Risks, Execution)
- Use architecture-decisions skill
- Use code-standards-enforcer skill
- Use ci-cd-pipeline-builder skill

### Week 3+: Execution
- Complete Sections 9-12 (Monitoring, ROI, Governance, Lessons)
- Use agile-executor skill daily
- Use project-risk-identifier skill weekly
- Update sections as project evolves

## Key Features

- **Progressive Disclosure** - Start with overviews, dive deeper when needed
- **Cross-Referenced** - Everything links to relevant sections
- **Template-Based** - Copy and customize for your project
- **Checklist-Driven** - 150+ verification items
- **Example-Rich** - 50+ real-world scenarios

## Next Steps

1. Read [README.md](./README.md) for detailed implementation guide
2. Start with [1. Executive Summary](./planning/1-Executive-Summary.md)
3. Test a Claude skill: "What tech stack should we use?"
4. Review [docs/reference/TECHNICAL-SUMMARY.md](./docs/reference/TECHNICAL-SUMMARY.md) for technical details
