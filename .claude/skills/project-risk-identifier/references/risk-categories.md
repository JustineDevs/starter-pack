- Performance bottlenecks
- Security vulnerabilities
- Integration failures
- Technology limitations
- Scalability issues
- Data loss or corruption

### Organizational Risks

- Team member departure
- Scope creep
- Budget overrun
- Timeline delays
- Communication breakdown
- Skill gaps
- Resource constraints

### Market/External Risks

- Regulatory changes
- Competitive pressure
- Economic downturn
- Vendor/service failure
- Market demand changes
- Partnership issues

### Project-Specific Risks

- [Project-specific risk 1]
- [Project-specific risk 2]

## Risk Assessment Matrix

```
        HIGH IMPACT
            │
            │  [High Risk Items]
            │
MEDIUM ─────┼───────────────
IMPACT      │  [Medium Risk Items]
            │
        LOW │  [Low Risk Items]
        IMPACT

              PROBABILITY
```

## Risk Scoring

**Probability:**
- Low: <30% chance
- Medium: 30-70% chance
- High: >70% chance

**Impact:**
- Low: Minor inconvenience
- Medium: Delays or cost increase
- High: Project failure or major setback

**Risk Level:**
- Low: Low probability + Low impact
- Medium: Medium probability OR Medium impact
- High: High probability OR High impact

## Mitigation Strategies

### Avoid
- Change project plan to eliminate risk

### Mitigate
- Reduce probability or impact

### Transfer
- Move risk to third party (insurance, vendor)

### Accept
- Acknowledge and monitor risk
