Welcome! This page will walk you through everything step-by-step.

## What Is This?

This is a **project planning toolkit**. It helps you:
- Plan your software project
- Make technical decisions
- Organize your work
- Track your progress

## Your First 5 Minutes

### Step 1: Understand the Structure

The Project Planning Starter Pack is organized into three main areas:

1. **Planning Sections** - 12 templates you fill in to plan your project
2. **Documentation** - Guides and reference materials
3. **Tools** - AI assistance and automation

### Step 2: Start with Planning

Begin with [Section 1: Executive Summary](/planning/1-Executive-Summary). This helps you clarify:
- What you're building
- Why it matters
- Who it's for

### Step 3: Use the Templates

Each planning section is a template with:
- Placeholders to fill in (like `[Your Project Name]`)
- Examples to guide you
- Checklists to verify completeness
