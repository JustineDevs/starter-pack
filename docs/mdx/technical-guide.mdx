# Technical Guide

Complete technical execution and implementation guide.

## Overview

The technical guide covers all aspects of implementation, from tech stack selection to deployment.

## Key Sections

### Tech Stack Selection

Framework for choosing technologies:

- Language and runtime selection
- Database selection
- Hosting and infrastructure
- Authentication and security
- Monitoring and observability

**Reference:** [planning/5-Technical-Execution-Workflow.md](/planning/5-Technical-Execution-Workflow.md)

### Architecture Patterns

Choose the right pattern:

- Monolithic (MVP, simple domains)
- Microservices (complex, high scale)
- Serverless (event-driven, variable load)
- Layered/N-Tier (enterprise, regulatory)

### Development Workflow

Complete development standards:

- Code organization
- Coding standards
- Code review process
- Version control (Git)
- Testing strategy

### CI/CD Pipelines

Automated deployment:

- GitHub Actions workflows
- Testing and security scans
- Deployment automation
- Monitoring and alerts

### Performance & Scalability

Optimization strategies:

- Frontend performance
- Backend performance
- Database optimization
- Horizontal scaling
- Reliability patterns
