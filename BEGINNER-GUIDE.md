# Welcome! Your First Steps Guide

**Are you completely new here?** This guide will walk you through everything step-by-step.

## What Is This Project?

Think of this as a **complete toolkit** for planning and building software projects. Instead of starting from scratch, you have:

- ✅ **Templates** - Pre-written documents you fill in
- ✅ **Guides** - Step-by-step instructions
- ✅ **AI Help** - Claude can assist with decisions
- ✅ **Structure** - Everything organized for you

**Real-world example:** Imagine you want to build a mobile app. This toolkit helps you:
1. Plan what the app does (planning sections)
2. Decide what technology to use (tech stack guide)
3. Organize your code (file structure)
4. Track progress (monitoring tools)

## Common Questions

### "I don't know what to write in the templates"
**Answer:** That's okay! The templates have examples and placeholders. Start with what you know, even if it's rough. You can refine it later.

### "Which section should I start with?"
**Answer:** Always start with Section 1 (Executive Summary). It helps you clarify your vision, which makes the other sections easier.

### "What if I skip some sections?"
**Answer:** That's fine! Focus on what matters for your project. Sections 1-4 are most important for getting started.

### "How do I use Claude Skills?"
**Answer:** In Cursor (this editor), just ask Claude questions like:
- "What tech stack should I use for a web app?"
- "Help me create an architecture decision"
- "Review my code for quality"

### "Where do I actually write code?"
**Answer:** After planning, you'll write code in the `src/` directory. But first, complete your planning sections!
